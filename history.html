<div id="History">
		<h2>Pre-Maipelan Era (200-900 PL)</h2>
		<p>During the days of Israve, the Nizhnyveans lived in Western Isrudi, the nizhnyveans here were the Israve, or natively, the Ölmōrošie <em>(IPA : [œɬʲmøːɾɔʂɨj])</em>. The Israve, </p>
		<h2>Early Maipelan Era (900-1200 PL)</h2>
		<h2>The Era of Vinlanders (1200-1300 PL)</h2>
		<h2>The Blood Era (1300-1885 PL)</h2>
		<h2>The Era of Colonisation (1885-2230 PL)</h2>
		<h2>Era of Revolution (2230-2320 PL)</h2>
		<p> By 2230, a lot of nizhnvyeans were tired of the monarchs, the first major rebellion against them, dubbed the Sahena Revolution, was a revolt headed in the town of Sahena, 
		<h2>Corrupt Era (2320-2371 PL)</h2>
		<p>After the mass protests in Nizhnyve, the Provisional Senate held elections, the provisional leader Iba Dibatsoni, had not wanted to lose power, so he covertly undermined the elections, faking the result for him to win, That got many people angry but they were silenced. Dibatsoni's reign was marked with confusion and corruption. Dibatsoni had lead nizhnyve to a victory against tribes in Litmak, Expanding the empire, which at this time he was also meeting with other powers to organise the fall of the rosian empire. Dibatsoni approved the assassination of Emperor Gideion XI. which lead to his daughter, Amatsonge dzem Gulimak in power, becoming Amatsonge III, she turned out to be a huge obstacle for Dibatsoni, as he could not get anything done without <em>her permission</em>. She eneded up dismissing him in 2322, but in a strike of confusion, elections were never held, Amatsonge III headed the Ezhago 1st celebrations, inviting people all across the world to come witness the holy holiday. <br> <br> Dibatsoni returned in 2326, and immediately had his eyes on Kanajho, he eneded up attacking, and then waited for them to delcare war, however, the war did not go as planned, Kanajho, had beat them to the border of east Kanajho, Later Dibatsoni met with the leaders of Kirona and Tokagebac, to form a new alliance, which would be known as the black cross. And then in 2327, Dibatsoni accepted defeat in Kanajho, sceding East Kanajho to Kanajho. This became a national embarassment, Nizhnyve had lost a major war, and so support for Dibatsoni Dipped, In 1828, he disbanded the Reform Party and made the Unity Party. In 2328, he introduced a law that made drinking alcohol premitted, which had staunch opposition from the religious people. Later that year, the IAN masterplot on the containment of Dibatsoni by faking a threat of war on kanbon, they also planned to assassinate Amatsonge III once Kanbon had cut ties. Once the initial threat had been done, Dibatsoni was ousted, and the Reform Party <br> <br> 
		<h2>Zilorist Era and Flourishing Democracy (2371-2411 PL)</h2>
		<p>In 2371, Normac Zilor, who became leader of the Nizhnvyean Democratic Party in 2370, had written a new constitution, which outlined the importance of transparency and fair elections, this ended what was known as the Era of Corruption, an era in which leaders would do anytihng to better them, Zilor became the first leader of Nizhnyve under this new system, and his leadership would transform Nizhnyve from a oppressive empire, to a beacon of democracy. Zilor during his reign tried to sign the <em>Term length and limit act</em> which passed the Dakhaf 239-61, Zilor would be the last leader to have 2 5 year terms, instead the limit was now abolished, but each term lasts 6 years. There was an attempted Communist Coup in 2378, but Zilor ended up killing the leader, the people hailing him as a hero. In the 2381 election, Zilor opted not to run, instead leaving his second hand man, Domana Rapas to run for the Nizhnvyean Democratic Party, but Rapas lost to the new Liberal Democratic Party of Nizhnyve, founded by Tegesaw Yu'sif under the Unity Coaltion with the Nizhnyvean Congressinal Party., a Lasya man, and Grandfather of the later Yamasaw Jusif. <br> <br> Under Tegesaw, Nizhnyve saw an economic reform, supported by his Unity Coalition, this saw massive boosts to the economy, which even Zilor, now the senator for Gatar, his home city, voted in favour of. Tegesaw however, declined to run again, and the Liberal Democratic Party lost the majority in tthe coaltion so the new leader of the coaltion would be the Nizhnvyean Congressinal Party, lead by Juri Sekoniv. Sekoniv had run on a platform of a United Nizhnyve, and wanting to abolish the Federal Empire, the Dakhaf was perfectly split on this, 150-150, and so the Emperor had to weigh in on this, He chose in favour of Centralization and so on June 30th 2390, the Federal Empire of Nizhnvye was abolished, and renamed to the Empire of Nizhnvye, protests arised all across the empire, but Sekoniv had assured them that this would not ruin thier representatition. <br> <br> Zilor, begged by his party, ran in the 2394 elections, which Zilor, after not ruling for years, was sure he would lose the elections again, but to his surprise he won by a land slide win, and had no need for a coalition, and so this began Zilor's second reign, which would see him reform the currency, droppnig the Nyaman in favour of the new Nyogiv, which was authourised by the emperor. Zilor however did not have any opposition, under his reign, people begged him to improve slum conditions, which he listened to, and in preperations for the 2400 elections, Zilor really did not want to run for office, but his party begged him to run one more time, which he accepted regretfully. Zilor won again on a platform of a "No Nonsense Nizhnyve!", But sadly, on June 3rd, 2401, a rogue gun man shot him dead, and so his vice prime minister, Gorkha Nalman, became the Prime Minister, His reign saw the Great Lichrene war, where he protected Helain with fury. Nothing of note happened during his reign, but in 2405, the Intelligence Agency of Nizhnyve found that Zilor was forced into exile by the army sent to Nizhnyvean Taneo, faking his death, He was returned to Nizhnyve and lead the NDP until the 2407 election, where he finally retired from politics, Nalman now went up against the very popular Yamasaw Jusif, leader of the Nizhnvye First party. It was a land slide for Yamasaw, and so the term of Jusif begun. <br> <br> Jusif's first reign was marked by his determination to better the nation, During Nalmans reign, he prioritised workers over the economy, which ended up wrecking the economy, Jusif had be determined to fix this, and so he passed several reforms taht would make the economy heal, this made people hail Jusif as a great leader, but then these reforms in 2408 backfired, and the economy of nizhnyve was ruined, this got people angry, and so in 2410, Jusif resigned, and he started a side election, secretly he started to plan for a post-election coup, when the time is right. Gorikh Nalmans NDP won, with them focussing on the nations greatness, but the invasion of Mysheik in 2410 caused a rogue senator from Gakku to shoot him in the face, killing him, Arafja Naksal became the leader in 2411, and then Jusif, 2 weeks later, Couped the Government, During this time, Zilor was in intense care at the Lipetsk National Hospital, when he heard the news that Jusif had couped the government, and that he was now undermining Zilors Constitution, Zilor cried, and he said his final words... "Kakij mèkeva C̣engàrit" which means "God Save Nizhnyve". And so with the death of Zilor and Jusif's dictatorship, Nizhnyve plummeted into the Jusif Era... </p>
		<h2>Jusif Era and the Imperial Federation (2411-2416 PL)</h2>
        <p> On June 23rd, 2411, Jusif and his supporters marched on the Dákhaf, with tanks, guns and weaponry, they chanted "JUSIF IS OUR LEADER! JUSIF CAN FIX THIS!". While the gaurds were distracted, Troops went in, and on June 23rd, at 2:34 PM, Jusif was made ruler of the Federal Empire of Nizhnyve, and he did major reform, but he wasnt 100% popular, so to silence them, he introduced anti free speach laws, and made it illegal to critize Jusif and his government. He also disbanded elections later that year. In 2413, Jusif declared the "Imperial Federation" a collection of semi-indpendent member republics, they as as follows. Nizhnyvia, L'aza, Korithia, Margitant, Snamidore, East Kanajho, Gakku, and the United Protectorate of Litmak, United Republic of Helai, and the Union of Taneo States. They all came together under the banner of the <em>Imperial Federation (Nizhnvyean: Rèšuto Ġamec̣ (IPA : [reʃuːtɔː ʤaːmʰəts] Olmorian : Ēʃutō Jāmets (IPA : [ɜʃʊːtœː ʈʂʷʼæːmɜːtsʰ])</em>. It was at this time also when Jusif had been dissapearing from the public more and more. Culminating in the announcement of his diagnosis with cancer on April 30th 2415. Around this time, kanbon erupted in civil conflict, which Jusif, being pro-kanbon, supported the central government, Despite the opposition sharing a lot of views with Jusif, he believed that the central government would be more beneficial to support, Jusif then appointed a new Minister of war, Arisanas Savoi, a Lichrenean-Kanajho man, who by most definitions, was fit for the position, he was the original Supreme Commander of Nizhnyvean Troops in South Kanbon. Savoi made great succeses in teh war, at high human price, but he pushed through, On January 31st, 2416, Jusif had appointed Savoi his successor to the title of Supreme Leader of Nizhnvye. Then Jusif later had a surgery to go to, and while he was gone, Savoi became Acting Leader of the Imperial Federation, during his surgery however, Jusif had died. Savoi had announced to the nation on June 25th, 2416 that Supreme Leader Yamasaw Jusif had died and that he was his successor to the title of Supreme Leader. The death of Jusif ripped the nation in 2, with Anti-Savoists (Mainly Nizhnyve and Margitant) against Pro-Savoists (Korithia, East Kanajho, and Snamidora)</p>
		<h2>Savoist Era (2416-2418 PL)</h2>
		<p> In 2416, Savoi had announced the production of a new type of air craft meant to be flown in kanbon to combat the National Socialist Republic of Kanbon, the first squadrents flew across the skies, doing attack campaigns across Kanbon. In 2417, The NSR Kanbon had fallen, and so now Savoi could get to running the nation, which his first order of bussiness was to immediately kill all of his opposition. In late 2417, Savoi was found out to be a secret supplier of the NSR Kanbon, which got the entire population mad, and so the Kasav Protests Begun, the largest protests since 2320, Savoi gave clear orders to the police, Shoot on sight, This became the known as Bloody September, around 4,300 pepole ended up dying. In Nizhnyvean Aquilon, the Third Avalandorian Genocide occured, where the systematic extinction of Avalandorians in the Imperial Federation was ordered. In 2418, after a series of issues, mass protests occured in 2419, Which Savoi tried desperately to destroy, but it did not end well for Savoi, a protester managed to get into the Palace of the Rulers, and shot Savoi 3 times in the chest, Which lead to the end of Savoi and the dicatator ship, Elections were to be held in 2418.</p>
